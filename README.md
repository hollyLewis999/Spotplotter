SpotPlotter is an open-source tool designed for automated image analysis of microbial spotting assays. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, SpotPlotter converts images of microbial assays into quantitative data, making it ideal for applications like tuberculosis research.

## ‚ú®Features
üîç Image Processing Pipeline: The project developed a flexible, adaptive pipeline that preprocesses, segments, and post-processes images. 

üìä Automated Data Analysis: The system automatically performed statistical analysis, generating clear visual outputs, like scatter plots, to show trends across different plate conditions. 

üíª User-Friendly GUI: A simple and intuitive GUI was built, giving users control over the pipeline and allowing manual adjustments to refine results.

Demos of the system can be found below:
