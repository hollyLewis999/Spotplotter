🔍 Image Processing Pipeline: The project developed a flexible, adaptive pipeline that preprocesses, segments, and post-processes images. Despite non-ideal images with lighting issues or cracks, the algorithm produced reliable segmentation and quantification results.

📊 Automated Data Analysis: The system automatically performed statistical analysis, generating clear visual outputs, like scatter plots, to show trends across different plate conditions. This feature enhances transparency by linking back to the original image data for validation.

💻 User-Friendly GUI: A simple and intuitive GUI was built, giving users control over the pipeline and allowing for manual adjustments to improve results.
